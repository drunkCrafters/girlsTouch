# girlsTouch
Oh the wonders of the world...

Yes this is a funny name, not only for the mod to be, but who we are! Only one of us is a girl, so do not tell my partner the name of this. This may, or may not, be my own work of art time will tell!

I hope to have this up and going by the end of June 2015, so keep looking back to see what is happening. I named the mod to be girlsTouch so I can add some awesome: colors, blocks, powers, items, mobs and such for a frilltastic adventure.
